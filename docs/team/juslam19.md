### Project: MedBook

MedBook is a **desktop app health monitoring system for healthcare professionals** that simplifies tracking patientâ€™s medical information and hospital records via a Command Line Interface (CLI). MedBook delivers a seamless workflow for doctors and healthcare professionals to search for or update patients' emergency contacts, medical information, medical tests, consultations and prescriptions through a simple and easy-to-use platform.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Patient's Consultation
  * What it does: It allows the user to add consultations for each patient.
  * Justification: This features extend the product functionality as a health monitoring system to store patients' consultations. Medical professionals can see past consultation information of patients, such as diagnosis, fees, and additional notes.
  * Credits: The feature was built on top of [AddressBook Level 3 (AB3)](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3). Some part of the codes were adapted and modified.
  
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=juslam19&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-02-18&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zA=clement0010&zR=AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&zACS=NaN&zS=2022-02-18&zFS=clement&zU=2022-03-06&zMG=false&zFTF=commit&zFGS=groupByRepos&zFR=false&tabAuthor=clement0010&tabRepo=AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **Enhancements Implemented:**
  1. App User Interface 
      1. Made modifications to the application to ensure better User Experience. Pull request: [#116](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/116) 
          * Implemented the wrapping of text in the app's respective elements, so text will not be truncated/ run off-screen.
          * Added ability for result display to grow in size as window size increased, to take advantage of screen real-estate.
          * Returned the ability to resize the window after approved PR wrongly caused that. 
      2. Added functionality to messages shown in result display
         1. Standardised format of all types of messages in result display. Pull requests: [#116](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/116), [#225](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/225), [#234](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/234)
             * For example: For the incorrect format of `add` command message, I ensure that for every type (patient, contact, consultation, medical, prescription, test) use the same format -- the same error message, followed by the proper format and parameter of the command, followed by an example of the command.
             * A similar approach is used for every message (e.g. duplicate, does not exist, etc.) that is present in each type (patient, contact, consultation, medical, prescription, test).
             * This is repeated for all the commands, which include but are not limited to: `add`, `view`, `edit`, `delete`.
         2. Added patient name to result display messages for `view t/TYPE i/NRIC` commands, for clarification to user. Pull request: [#116](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/116)
         3. Ensured catching of errors to be caught and shown on result display, for clarification to user. Pull requests: [#225](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/225)
  2. Added increased functionality to the application
      * Added scroll bar with incremental arrow buttons. Pull request: [#116](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/116)
      * Added styling that causes scroll bar buttons to respond visually to hover and presses.
  3. Contributed to standardising command behavior
     * Ensured `edit t/medical INDEX` command followed other types' `edit` command -- only valid if at least one optional field is filled out. Pull request: [#240](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/240)
  4. Added Dummy data when data file unavailable
      * Added dummy consultation entries to populate MedBook when existing data file is not detected, indicating newly downloaded application or reset of existing MedBook application.
  5. Code Quality
      * Wrote test cases to increase code coverage from XX% to XX%. Pull request: [WIP]()

* **Contributions to the UG:**
  * Added patients' consultation section. Pull request: [#130](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/130)
  * Modified others' sections if there is incorrect documentation. Pull request: [#226](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/226)
  
* **Contributions to the DG:**
  * Added description of how consultation commands works, and UML diagram of the Consultation command logic. Pull request: [#90](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/pull/90)
  
* **Contributions to Team-Based Tasks:**
  * Contributed to product concept brainstorming.
  * Contributed to brainstorming of user stories.
  * Contributed to adapting of AB3 UG to the MedBook product (no traces of AB3 left).
  * Contributed to the updating of AB3 DG sections (product scope, user stories, use cases, NFRs, etc.) to the MedBook product.
