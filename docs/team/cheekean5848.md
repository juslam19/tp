### Project: MedBook

MedBook is a **desktop app health monitoring system for healthcare professionals** that simplifies tracking patient’s medical information and hospital records via a Command Line Interface (CLI). MedBook delivers a seamless workflow for doctors and healthcare professionals to search for or update patients' emergency contacts, medical information, medical tests, consultations and prescriptions through a simple and easy-to-use platform.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Patient's Medical Prescription
  
    It allows user to add medical prescription information to the patients. This feature 
    extends the product functionality by allowing medical professionals to keep track of
    patients' medical prescription records. This feature was built on top of [AddressBook Level 3 (AB3)](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3).



* **New Feature**: Command History Navigation

    It enhances the user experience by allowing users to navigate through the command
    history by pressing the `↑` and `↓` arrow keys.



* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=cheekean5848&breakdown=true)


* **Enhancement implemented**:

    * Summary View User Interface
        * Designed and created the user interface of summary page
    * Delete logic
        * Extended the function of deleting patient to deleting all the patient's details (medical info, contact, etc.)
    * Command Manager
        * Created a manager to parse the user's command type and execute the relevant command.
